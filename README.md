# hello-world
This is my first repository on GH

Hello all, Joe here. I am just beginning to learn how to program in python. 
I hope to move on to JS, HTML5, CSS, and SQL in the near future. 

**About Me**
My goal is to work on my portfolio website, build a commercial website for my "Web Design/Development" business or freelance site, and continue to focus on at least front-end development for now. I am also working with gaining more skills in Adobe Creative Suite to increase my design "cred" and working on Salesforce Trailheads to have more CRM skills.
